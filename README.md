# Planimeter
A 3D Printable digital planimeter. 

By using off-the-shelf hardware and using a simple potentiometer to measure the rotation of the wheel, this will be cheap to build and accessible to a wide audience.

To build this, you will need:

- [a 10-turn potentiometer](https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-3590S-2-103L-10-Turn-Precision-Potentiometer/dp/B079JN626M/), any will do so long as it has a shaft diameter of 1/4 inch and a threaded diameter of 0.36 inches. These typically come with a 1/2 inch nut.
- [two 1/4 inch wooden square dowels](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08HQX2Q13/). These are the connecting rods of the planimeter.
- An O-ring (size to be determined). This forms the grippy rolling surface of the wheel.
- [two #8 3/4 inch truss head screws](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002ZPF12/). These are used for pivots.
- [four M4 threaded thumb screws](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B097HD2CZF). These are used to secure the rods. Thumb screws are used so that the rod lengths are adjustable, but regular M4 screws could be used if you are fine with getting out a screw driver whenever you adjust the rods.

Of course, the design is parametric, so you can modify it to suit whatever hardware is most readily availlable to you. You may also want an M4 thread tap, since some 3D printers will be unable to resolve the fine details of the threads.
